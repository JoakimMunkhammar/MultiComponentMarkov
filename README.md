# MultiComponentNstate
MultiComponentNstate.m is a program that uses the multiple-component N-state Markov-chain mixture distribution model published in:

Munkhammar J., Wid√©n J., A spatiotemporal Markov-chain mixture distribution model of the clear-sky index, Solar Energy, 179, 398-409, 2019.

This code trains the model on time-series of two components of global, beam and diffuse clear-sky index to generate two correlated time-series of the components.

The code uses the file GHIBHIDHI_Synth_data.txt as input for global, beam and diffuse clear-sky index training data. This file is mock-up synthetic data.

The code was written by Dr. Joakim Munkhammar, PhD, 2021.
